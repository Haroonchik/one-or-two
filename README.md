A hand gesture model from [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to detect 1 and 2 in a picture.

Hosted at https://one-or-two.herokuapp.com/.

> Sample inputs have been provided in the [`./samples`](samples) directory.

## Aim

The aim of making this web app was to learn how to connect a model with a web app. Even though that was sort of achieved, there are a lot of problems with the model and results. Working on the issues!
